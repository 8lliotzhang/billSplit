# billSplit

Did you go on a group trip recently with four friends? Did you end up paying for the whole table because you were scared to ask for separate checks? Did you end up having to make a large number of cash exchanges to settle debts after the fact and the resulting economic drama led to the dissolution of your friend group? Do you live in shame everyday because of how you allowed petty disputes to take precedence over years of camraderie?

**Billsplit** is here to resolve all your problems! The financial ones, at least. Reconciling with your friends - you're on your own, sorry. 

Just another summer project. Killing time.
